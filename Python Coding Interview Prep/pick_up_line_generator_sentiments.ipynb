        "You are tasked with creating a Python script for a pick-up line generator. The program should generate pick-up lines based on different sentiments such as romantic, funny, cheesy, or flirty.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Requirements:\n",
        "\n",
        "The script should contain a function generate_pickup_line(sentiment) that takes a sentiment as input and returns a randomly selected pick-up line from the corresponding sentiment category.\n",
        "The sentiment categories and pick-up lines should be organized in a dictionary or a similar data structure within the script.\n",
        "The program should allow users to specify the sentiment category for the pick-up line they want to generate.\n",
        "The script should include a main section where it prompts the user to enter a sentiment category, calls the generate_pickup_line function with the specified sentiment, and prints the generated pick-up line.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
